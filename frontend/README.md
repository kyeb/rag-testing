This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Working with Protobufs

The frontend communicates with the LLM service using gRPC. The protocol buffer definitions are in the `protos` directory. If you modify the proto files or pull updates from the LLM service, you'll need to regenerate the TypeScript types:

```bash
# Install dependencies if you haven't already
yarn install

# Generate TypeScript types from proto files
yarn generate-proto-types
```

The generated types will be placed in the `protos` directory and are automatically imported by the gRPC client code.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
